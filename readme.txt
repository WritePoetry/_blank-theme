== Description ==



== Changelog ==

= 0.0.4 =
* Including CSS for block styles without write a line of code: you just need to add the css files following the
naming convention rule: `my-theme/assets/css/blocks/prefix/blockname.css` (i.e., `blankspace/assets/css/blocks/core/site-title.css`).
the file will load automatically only when the block with the same name will be rendered.
In addition, if you want to change the default base folder for blocks styles (`assets/css/blocks`) you can use this filter `blank_theme_blocks_styles_asset_path`

= 0.0.1 =
* Initial release
